1. How de we create a new namespace?
We can create a namespace by defining a module which is
a set of variables, objects or functions between the keyswords module and end.
The name of the module defines the name of the namespace.

2. How do we expose the functions of a module to the outside world?
Using the keyword export.

3. How do we reference the proper function when the same function name is exported from different packages?
Using the module name from where the function belongs. (i.e. Calculator.rate)

4. When do we separate code into multiple modules?
When a module becomes too large.

5. Why is semantic versioning important in managing package dependencies?
Because it avoids problems with package update by keeping a version of each dependency.

6. How is defining functional behavior for abstract types usefully?
Because we can just focus in functional behavior and the possible interactions between them.
Defining common behaviors for types.

7. When should we make a type mutable?
When the type will be updated at some point.

8. How are parametric types useful?
You can define generic types that are defined during runtime automatically.
