1. How are positional arguments different from keyword arguments?
2. What is the difference between splatting and slurping?
3. What is the purpose of using the do-syntax?
4. What tool is available for detecting method ambiguities as related to multiple dispatches?
5. How do you ensure that the same concrete type is passed to a function in a parametric method?
6. How are interfaces implemented without any formal language syntax?

7. How do you implement traits, and how are traits useful?

You can implement traits with a default function definition that returns a default value in the interface
and for the concrete types you can implement its expected code. They are useful to model object behaviors.
